# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Conclusion of my Report:
In this report, we developed a credit card fraud detection classifier using a Logistic Regression model , Random Forest Classifier,Gradient Boosting Classifier. Here are the key points to summarize:
Data Preprocessing: We loaded the credit card fraud dataset, split it into features (X) and the target variable (y), and applied feature scaling to standardize the data.

Model Training: We trained a Logistic Regression classifier,Random Forest Classifier,Gradient Boosting Classifier on the preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report. Accuracy provides an overall measure of correct predictions, while the confusion matrix and classification report offer a detailed breakdown of model performance, including precision, recall, F1-score, and support.

Results: The model achieved an accuracy of [94%], indicating its ability to correctly classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
In conclusion, credit card fraud detection is crucial for financial institutions and consumers alike. While this report presents a basic implementation, further refinement and exploration of advanced techniques are essential for building robust and effective fraud detection systems.
